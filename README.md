# Isogram Extractor

This is just a small exercise in object oriented PHP. 

My goal was to have a long list of German 10 char isograms. 

## What is an isogram?

An isogram is a word without repeating letters. 

## Why would someone want to have such a list?

A friend of mine told me, that he "encrypts" his bank card pins by having such an 10 char isogram and replace the numbers with letters.  
I told a friend about it and thought about writing an app to mass "encrypt" certain pins. And I want to have a list of such words for people to pick from. 

## What have I done?

- find a website with German 10 char words
- scrap the word lists
- find the isograms
- save them to files (as I don't know how I will proceed with that, I exported the list to CSV, JSON and plain tex)

## Why is this here?

Why not? And to show my skills and maybe someone can use the idea and what ever :)
